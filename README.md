## The Dataset

The dataset originates from Kermany et al. on [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3).

The particular subset used for this project is sourced via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The subset contains 5,863 rgb chest x-ray images, in JPEG format. Images are organized into folders for training, validation, and testing, each of which is split into 'NORMAL' AND 'PNEUMONIA' subfolders.
